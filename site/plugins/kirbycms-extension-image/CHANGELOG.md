# 0.7

* Add a new KirbyText tag to insert a gallery, with the same function like from the image KirbyText tag. (Initial and not complete)

# 0.6

* Option to disable `width` and `height` attribute. Good for responsive Layout design.

# 0.5

* Bugfix
* Add the new config option 'kirbytext.image.caption_field'. With this config option you can define a custom file field, what will be read for the caption of an image. Only when the config parmeter 'kirbytext.image.caption' or the parameter `caption` is 'true'. When the config parameter is true, you can selectiv deactivate it for an image. Just set the parameter `caption` to 'false'. When you write a different text into the `caption` parameter, this will be used. 

# 0.4

* Move the logic into to a plugin (static method). So you can use the function every where in Kirby (template, other KirbyTag, ...)
* Add many possible Kirby config options (I know this is not perfect, because I am using the kirby namespace. But when anyone have a idea for a better namespace. Please tell your idea. As ABAP developer I would change it to zkirbytext....)
* Optimize the logic

# 0.3

* Initial version
